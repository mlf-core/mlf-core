        handle: mlflow-xgboost
        version: 1.3.2
        available libraries: XGBoost
        short description: Fully CPU and GPU reproducible MLflow based XGBoost template.
        long description: A fully CPU and GPU reproducible MLflow based XGBoost template with CPU, single-GPU and
                        system-intelligence support. The initialized project contains a Covertype example.
    xgboost_dask:
        name: XGBoost-Dask
        handle: mlflow-xgboost_dask
        version: 1.2.2
        available libraries: XGBoost, Dask
        short description: MLflow and Dask based XGBoost template.
        long description: A MLflow based XGBoost template with CPU, single-GPU, multi-GPU and
                        system-intelligence support. The initialized project contains a Covertype example.
                        Due to Dask's non-deterministic shuffling the template may not always be reproducible!
package:
    prediction:
        name: Prediction
        handle: package-prediction
        version: 1.0.2
        available libraries: Pytorch, Tensorflow, XGBoost
        short description: Python package offering loading and prediction of models with simple PyPI deployment.
        long description: A Python package offering a command-line interfaces for predictions for custom models.
            Depending on the chosen library/framework the template offers the appropriate way of loading the model.
            The Python package is trivially distributed via PyPI.
